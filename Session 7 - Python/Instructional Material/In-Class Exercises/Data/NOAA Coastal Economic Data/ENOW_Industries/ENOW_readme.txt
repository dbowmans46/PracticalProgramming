Data Notes

-GeoID is derived from the 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standards codes (FIPS codes) delineated by the National Institute of Standards 
 and Technology.  Region codes are created by the NOAA Office of Coastal Management. 

-Values of -9999 identify data that are suppressed. These data non-zero values but cannot be reported due to data confidentiality laws.

-Values of 0 are true zeros. They indicate that there was no economic activity in that particular industry or sector for that year.

-Ocean economy totals or all ocean sectors (Industry or sector totals) will not necessarily equal a computed sum of the sectors.
 This is because the reported ocean economy totals include values that may have been suppressed in the components that make up the total.

-Shore values of 1 indicate that a county as shore-adjacent.
-Shore values of 0 indicate that a county is not shore-adjacent.


-The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revise their GDP estimates for all years of data on an annual basis. With the annual release of new ENOW data, gross domestic product (GDP) for the ocean economy are updated for the entire time series to reflect the revision of GDP. In addition, BEA rebenchmark the entire GDP account every five years to better reflect the evolving nature of the U.S. economy. The rebenchmarking involves making changes to what is included in different industries, as well as classifying new and emerging industries. The current benchmark for the GDP industries is 2017.


-According to the U.S. Census Bureau, three coastal counties in Alaska (02201, 02232, 02280) were dissolved during the time series of
 the dataset and were replaced by four newly formed counties (02105, 02195, 02198, 02275).  All of these counties are provided in the
 dataset for historical context, and are reported as 0 for years where the counties did not exist.

-An additional industry, Fish and Seafood Merchant Wholesalers (NAICS 424460) was added to the Living Resources sector's Seafood Market industry for data years 2016 and beyond. The industry was not applied to earlier years.
