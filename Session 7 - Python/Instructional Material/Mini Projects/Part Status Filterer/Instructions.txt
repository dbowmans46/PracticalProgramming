A coworker has made a database that depicts all parts in repair, their current location in the repair cycle, the demand for the part, the need-repaired-by date, estimated time to repair part in person-hours, and whether the part is anticipated to be on schedule, behind schedule, or ahead of schedule.  There is also a large amount of unnecessary data.  Your boss wants the data organized in a way that makes it clear which parts need priority with respect to man power and resources.  

Filter the data to remove unnecessary data, and then order the data based on which parts should be worked in descending order.  Color coding is a bonus.
